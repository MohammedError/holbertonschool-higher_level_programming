The ``101-lazy_matrix_mul`` module
==================================

Using ``lazy_matrix_mul``
-------------------------

Importing the function:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul = __import__('101-lazy_matrix_mul').lazy_matrix_mul

Basic Multiplication:
    >>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
    [[ 7 10]
     [15 22]]

    >>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]]))
    [[13 16]]

--- Edge Cases and Exceptions (NumPy behavior) ---

m_a is a string:
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul("Holberton", [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    ...

m_b is a string:
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 6], [7, 8]], "Holberton")
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    ...

m_a is empty list of lists:
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    ...

m_b is empty list of lists:
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    ...

m_a contains strings (mixed types):
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[5, "6"], [7, 8]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    ...

m_b contains strings (mixed types):
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[5, "6"], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    ...

m_a jagged (rows of different size):
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 6, 10], [7, 8]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    ...

m_b jagged (rows of different size):
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[5, 6, 1], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    ...

Incompatible dimensions (3x2 * 2x3 is valid, but 2x3 * 2x2 is not):
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    ...
