The ``101-lazy_matrix_mul`` module
==================================

Using ``lazy_matrix_mul``
-------------------------

Importing the function:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul = __import__('101-lazy_matrix_mul').lazy_matrix_mul

Basic Multiplication:
    >>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
    [[ 7 10]
     [15 22]]

    >>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]]))
    [[13 16]]

--- Edge Cases and Exceptions (NumPy behavior) ---

Case: m_a is a string (Scalar operand)
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul("Holberton", [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    Scalar operands are not allowed, use '*' instead

Case: m_b is a string (Scalar operand)
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 6], [7, 8]], "Holberton")
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    Scalar operands are not allowed, use '*' instead

Case: m_a is a scalar integer (Scalar operand)
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul(1, [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    Scalar operands are not allowed, use '*' instead

Case: m_a is an empty list
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([], [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    shapes (0,) and (2,2) not aligned: 0 (dim 0) != 2 (dim 0)

Case: m_a is a list containing an empty list
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    shapes (1,0) and (2,2) not aligned: 0 (dim 1) != 2 (dim 0)

Case: m_b is an empty list
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 6], [7, 8]], [])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    shapes (2,2) and (0,) not aligned: 2 (dim 1) != 0 (dim 0)

Case: m_b is a list containing an empty list
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    shapes (2,2) and (1,0) not aligned: 2 (dim 1) != 1 (dim 0)

Case: m_a contains mixed types (strings and integers)
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[1, "2"], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print("Caught exception")
    Caught exception

Case: m_b contains mixed types (strings and integers)
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, "2"], [3, 4]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print("Caught exception")
    Caught exception

Case: m_a is jagged (rows of different sizes)
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print("Caught exception")
    Caught exception

Case: m_b is jagged (rows of different sizes)
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print("Caught exception")
    Caught exception

Case: Incompatible dimensions (2x2 and 1x2)
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2]])
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    shapes (2,2) and (1,2) not aligned: 2 (dim 1) != 1 (dim 0)

Case: Missing arguments
    >>> try:
    ...     lazy_matrix_mul()
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    lazy_matrix_mul() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'm_a' and 'm_b'
